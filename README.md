# homebrew-brews
Brew formulas that I might want to commonly install (either made myself or have lost their official/google-suggested homes).

## tsocks
Useful socks-tunneling program, great for getting past proxies. Previous tap hosting this formula (adamv, iirc) disappeared so I took it.

## tstools
Collection of cli utils for analysing Transport Stream files. Official version has linker issues on modern OSX. I forked it and merged across cmake changes from another fork to make it build. This formula is (currently) the most convenient way to install tstools on El Capitan.
